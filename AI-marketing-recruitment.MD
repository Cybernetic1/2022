Next-Generation AI Company
=================

Opportunities for AI enthusiasts
----------------------------------

This is a great opportunity to join the founding team of a cutting-edge AI company.  We want to build an AI system for automated marketing operations but with an eye to enhancing the capabilities of a general AI system.  Unlike other companies that may only copy the latest AI models without the potential for original innovations.

We are looking to fill 3 types of roles, but their definitions are  flexible:

1. LLM (Large Language Models) application designer
2. Machine learning to general AI transition engineer
3. AI-related web developer

### Requirements (ideally)

* We're looking for candidates interested in the latest developments in AI such as GPT and LLM (Large Language Models).
* The candidate should have some familiarity with traditional machine learning (ML).
* Our approach will combine GPT and traditional ML to provide functions such as chat bots and Q&A (question answering).
* We are also planning to train from-scratch our own language model which is based on an improvement over the Transformer.
* If you are a beginner in these areas you are still encouraged to apply, as we think that a learning attitude is the most important.
* We're trying to foster a community spirit of knowledge sharing, learning, and creativity.
* We welcome your original ideas but you must also be open to accept criticism and competition, as we have to brace ourselves for the imminent challenge of strong AI on a global stage.
* Optionally you are open to explore Web3 ideas such as NFT and DAO
